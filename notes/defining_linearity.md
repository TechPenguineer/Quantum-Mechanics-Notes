<hr><br>

- First equations written down in 1925 by Schrodinger and Heisenberg

- Discoverd in 19th century by Planck

- Quantum mechanics is a framework to do physics

- Replaced classic physics as the correct description of fundemental theory

- Quantum physics is the principles of quantum mechanics applied to different physical phenomenas

- **String theory:** a quantum theory of gravity and or all quantum interactions 

- Equation of motion is linearity ( EOM )

- Maxwells theory:
- - Electric Field 
- - Magnetic Field
- - Charge Density 
- - Current Density 

- Coresponds to a solution 

- Linearity Applies:
- - Alpha e
- - alpha b 
- - alpha row 
- - alpha j 
- New current is solution 
 
- Linarity applies you can multiply

- If you have two solutions, then linarity applies that the sum ```e1 + e2 + b1 + b2 + row1 + row2 + j1 + j2``` is also a solution 

- Linear Equation: `L u = 0`
- - u = unkown
- - L = linear operator
<br><br>
- Can have several linearal unkowns if you have several equations 
 
- `L(a*U)`
- - a = number
- `= a Lu`

- Multible equations with linear solution:
- - `L(u1+u2) = Lu1 + Lu2`

- if `u1` and `u2` are solutions: 
- - Means `Lu1 = Lu2 = 0`
- - `alpha u1 + beta  u2 = soltuion`

## Example

`du/dt+1/t U = 0`
- - `Lu = 0`
- - `Lu = du/dt + 1/T u`
<br><br>
- `L` alone
- - `L = d/dt + 1/t`

- Check if L is linear operator 
- - `L(au) = d(au)/dt + 1/T au = a( du/dt + 1
/T U) = aLu`
